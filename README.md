## Routes

- `/` — landing page
- `/resume-templates` — template gallery
- `/resume-builder` — interactive resume builder
- `/about` — about page
- `/contact` — contact page

## Design source

The downloaded `ResumeCraft_*` HTML/CSS exports were treated as the visual source of truth. The shared compiled stylesheet and local font assets were retained; the downloaded JavaScript bundles were not copied into the application.

## Reused application logic

Only essential pieces from the old Next.js project were carried over:

- resume data model and demo data
- template registry/definitions
- the 10 resume template components
- resume rendering/preview helpers
- the builder's local draft, editing, template switching, sample/reset, print, zoom, and mobile preview behaviors

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Verification performed in the sandbox

- All JavaScript/JSX source files were parsed/transpiled with the installed TypeScript compiler without syntax diagnostics.
- Route/component import paths were checked against the generated project tree.
- The 10-template registry was checked against all 10 template component files.
- Downloaded local font assets were retained and referenced by the stylesheet.

The sandbox could not complete `npm install`/`npm run build` because external npm registry DNS access was unavailable (`EAI_AGAIN registry.npmjs.org`). The source package is therefore delivered with its dependency manifest and PostCSS configuration ready for a normal networked install.
